Added new component CoordinateSearch with functionality to search for coordinates via input. Additionally added component CoordinateInput that allows the user to input coordinates manually and validates the input.

```tsx
<CoordinateSearch mapId="map_id" />
```

```tsx
<CoordinateInput mapId="map_id" />
```
