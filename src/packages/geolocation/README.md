# @open-pioneer/geolocation

This package provides a geolocation component based on [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_Geolocation-Geolocation.html) to locate a user's position.

## Usage

To add the component to your app, insert the following snippet with a reference to a map ID:

```jsx
<Geolocation mapId="map_id" />
```

If the geolocation was successful, the map is zoomed and centered to the user's position.

> Restriction: the map will only zoom once to the position directly after the geolocation was successful.
> After panning, or zoom in or zoom out of the map, the map isn't zoomed and centered after a changed user position.

To use a custom maximal zoom level add the optional property `maxZoom`. It will be zoomed to the extent of the accuracy feature but at most to the defined `maxZoom`.

```jsx
<Geolocation mapId="map_id" maxZoom={20} />
```

To configure the style of the user's position and accuracy, add the optional properties `positionFeatureStyle` or `accuracyFeatureStyle`:

```tsx
<Geolocation mapId="map_id" positionFeatureStyle={...} accuracyFeatureStyle={...} />
```

Both properties support arbitrary OpenLayers [`StyleLike`](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_Style.html#~StyleLike) values: you can configure either a single [Style](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_style_Style.html) instance, an array of them or a function computing such values.

```tsx
import { Circle as CircleStyle, Fill, Stroke, Style } from "ol/style";
import { Geolocation } from "@open-pioneer/geolocation";

const POSITION_STYLE = new Style({
    image: new CircleStyle({
        radius: 6,
        fill: new Fill({
            color: "#91CC33"
        }),
        stroke: new Stroke({
            color: "#FFF",
            width: 3
        })
    })
});

const ACCURACY_STYLE = new Style({
    stroke: new Stroke({
        color: "#91CC33",
        width: 3
    }),
    fill: new Fill({
        color: "rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.05)"
    })
});

function AppUI() {
    return (
        // ...
        <Geolocation
            mapId={MAP_ID}
            positionFeatureStyle={POSITION_STYLE}
            accuracyFeatureStyle={ACCURACY_STYLE}
        />
    );
}
```

To use custom position options from the [Geolocation API](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation/#position_options_interface), add the optional property `trackingOptions`.

```jsx
<Geolocation
    mapId="map_id"
    trackingOptions={{
        enableHighAccuracy: true,
        timeout: 60000,
        maximumAge: 600000
    }}
/>
```
