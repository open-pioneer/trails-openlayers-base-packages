## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

-   2090e72: Initial release.
    The purpose of this package is to develop UI components that are closely related to the map.

    The package `@open-pioneer/react-utils` has been moved into the [core-packages repository](https://github.com/open-pioneer/trails-core-packages/tree/main/src/packages/react-utils).
    Most contents of the package have been moved as well, if they can be used independently from the map.

    The component `ToolButton` has been moved into _this_ package instead.
    See also the [release notes](https://github.com/open-pioneer/trails-core-packages/releases/tag/%40open-pioneer%2Freact-utils%401.0.0) of `@open-pioneer/react-utils`.
