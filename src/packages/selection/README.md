# @open-pioneer/selection

This package provides a UI component to perform a selection on given selection sources from the map.

## Usage

To add the component to your app, import `Selection` from `@open-pioneer/selection`. The `@open-pioneer/notifier` package is required too.

The mandatory properties are `mapId` and `sources` (layer source to be selected on).
The limit per selection is 10.000 items.

```tsx
<Selection mapId={MAP_ID} sources={selectionsources} />
```

### Listening to events

To listen to the events `onSelectionComplete` and `onSelectionSourceChanged`, provide optional callback functions to the component.

In case of the `onSelectionComplete` event, you can access the selection result (and its source) from the parameter `SelectionCompleteEvent`.
In case of the `onSelectionSourceChanged` event, you can access the selected selection source from the parameter `SelectionSourceChangedEvent`.

```tsx
import { Search, SearchSelectEvent } from "@open-pioneer/search";
<Selection
    mapId={MAP_ID}
    sources={datasources}
    onSelectionComplete={(event: SelectionCompleteEvent) => {
        // do something
    }}
    onSelectionSourceChanged={(event: SelectionSourceChangedEvent) => {
        // do something
    }}
/>;
```

### Implementing a selection source

To provide the selection sources that are used by the selection-UI component, implement the function `select` for each selection source:

```tsx
import {
    Selection,
    SelectionResult,
    SelectionSource,
    SelectionSourceStatus
} from "@open-pioneer/selection";
import { MAP_ID } from "./MapConfigProviderImpl";

class MySelectionSource implements SelectionSource {
    // The label of this source, used as a title for this source's results.
    label = "My sample REST-Service";

    // The optional status of this source. If there is no status defined, it is assumed that the source is always available.
    status?: SelectionSourceStatus;

    // The reason that the source is not available. If it is not defined, the i18n value for "sourceNotAvailable" will be displayed
    unavailableStatusReason?: string;

    // Performs a selection with a given selectionKind and returns a list of selection results.
    // see the API documentation of `SelectionSource`.
    select(selectionKind: SelectionKind, options: SelectionOptions): Promise<SelectionResult[]>;
}

const selectionsources: SelectionSource[] = [new MySelectionSource()];

// In your JSX template:
<Selection mapId={MAP_ID} sources={selectionsources} />;
```

### VectorLayer as selection source

To use an OpenLayers VectorLayer with an OpenLayers VectorSource (e.g. layer of the map) as a selection source,
the provided service `SelectionSourceFactory` can be used to create an instance of `VectorLayerSelectionSource`.

Key features of this selection source implementation are:

-   using only the extent as selection kind
-   listening to layer visibility changes and updating the status of the source
-   limiting the number of returned selection results to the corresponding selection option
-   throwing an event `changed:status` when the status updates

Inject the selection source factory by referencing `"selection.SelectionSourceFactory"`:

```js
// build.config.mjs
import { defineBuildConfig } from "@open-pioneer/build-support";

export default defineBuildConfig({
    services: {
        YourService: {
            // ...
            references: {
                selectionSourceFactory: "selection.SelectionSourceFactory"
            }
        }
    }
});
```

and create a selection source instance:

```ts
const selectionSourceFactory = this._selectionSourceFactory; // injected
const layerSelectionSource = selectionSourceFactory.createSelectionSource({
    vectorLayer: vectorLayer,
    label: "My Vector Layer Title shown in UI"
});

const eventHandler = layerSelectionSource.on("changed:status", () => {
    // do something (e.g. like removing map highlighting if unavailable)
});
```
