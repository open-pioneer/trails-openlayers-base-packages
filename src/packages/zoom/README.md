# @open-pioneer/zoom

This package provides two buttons that allow the user to zoom in and zoom out of the map.

## Usage

To integrate the components in your app, insert the following snippet and reference a map ID:

```jsx
<ZoomIn mapId="map_id" />
<ZoomOut mapId="map_id" />
```

You can also use the generic `Zoom` component:

```jsx
<Zoom mapId="map_id" zoomDirection="in" />
```
