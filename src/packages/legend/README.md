# @open-pioneer/legend

This package provides a legend UI component that allows a user to see legend information for layers in the map.

The legend UI shows entries for layers that are currently visible (enabled) in the map.

## Usage

To add the component to your app, insert the following snippet with a reference to a map ID:

```jsx
<Legend mapId="map_id" />
```

### Configuring legend content for layers

For WMS and WMTS layers, the legend images (that are shown in the legend UI for the layer) are automatically
retrieved from the layer or sublayers.

However, for other layer types it is required to configure the legend content on the layer.
There are two options:

1. Configure a `Component` that is rendered as the legend for the layer.
2. Configure a URL to an image (`imageUrl`) that will be shown as a legend for the layer.
   If choosing this option, the layer's title will be shown above the legend image in the legend.

Examples:

```ts
//MapConfigProviderImpl.ts
import { CustomLegend } from "./CustomLegend"; // import react component to show as layer's legend
// ...

async getMapConfig(): Promise<MapConfig> {
    return {
        // ...
        layers: [
            new SimpleLayer({
                id: "topplus_open",
                title: "TopPlus Open",
                isBaseLayer: true,
                visible: true,
                olLayer: createTopPlusOpenLayer("web"),
                attributes: {
                    "legend": {
                        imageUrl:
                            "https://sg.geodatenzentrum.de/wms_topplus_open?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetLegendGraphic&FORMAT=image/png&LAYER=web"
                    }
                }
            }),
            new SimpleLayer({
                title: "Kindertagesst√§tten",
                visible: true,
                olLayer: createKitasLayer(),
                attributes: {
                    "legend": {
                        Component: CustomLegend
                    }
                }
            }),
        ]
    }
}
```

It is also possible to configure a legend for WMS and WMTS.
If a configuration is done, it supersedes the automatic legend retrieval.

Showing legend entries is also supported for **sublayers** (configuration and automatic retrieval).
The legend content for sublayers is shown plain and without hierarchical structure in the Legend UI.

### Showing legend for basemap

By default, the legend for the active basemap is not shown.
To show the legend for the active basemap, set the `showBaseLayers` prop to `true`:

```jsx
<Legend mapId="map_id" showBaseLayers={true} />
```
