# Some licenses are detected incorrectly.
# Their information can be overwritten here.
# Paths are relative to the project's directory on disk by default (somewhere in node_modules).
# Version and name must match exactly, otherwise entries here are not applied:
#
# To overwrite licenses with a custom file that is not part of the original package,
# configure the license like this:
#
#   - name: "some-package"
#     version: "1.0.6"
#     license: "MIT"
#     licenseFiles:
#      - custom: "./licenses/some-package-license.txt"
#
# `custom` makes the path relative to this directory instead of the package's directory.
