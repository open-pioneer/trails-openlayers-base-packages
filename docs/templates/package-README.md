> Keep it short and simple! Ask yourself two questions:
>
> 1. What does the package add to my application?
> 2. What can a developer or a user do with the added functionality?
>
> Samples:
>
> -   This package provides an "initial extent" button, to navigate the user back to the initial map view.
> -   This package provides helper classes, to build applications more easily and outsource repetitive tasks in your code.

## Usage

To add the component/button/... in your app, `[...]`.

```jsx
<Component />
```

> What do I need to do to use the package in the simplest way in my app?
>
> Sample:
>
> To add the button to your app, insert the following snippet with a reference to a map ID:
>
> ```jsx
> <InitialExtent mapId="map_id" />
> ```

To `[...]`, add the optional property `[...]`:

```jsx
<Component additionalProperty />
```

> Give samples for available properties to show how to use them.
> Always start with the value that this setting provides.
> ("To achieve this, do that." Not the other way around.)
