# Release Process

For the release of the open pioneer trails base packages, pipelines have been implemented so that
only a few manual steps (see below) are necessary to perform a release.

The release process is equivalent to the one of the open pioneer trails core packages.
Thus, refer to [TODO] for a release guide.
